Each day new protocols and technology springs up in web3 space which maybe a little unknown to newbies or beginners. The use of them for solving practical solutions is super important to drive mass adoption. Technologies ranging from Covalent,  LivePeer, Lens Protocol, Radicle, Superfluid and so on are developed to solve real life problems. Web3 is not only about smart contracts, there are other technologies that newbie developers can be familiar with to build their next unicorn. This innovation is majorly focused on beginners and intermediate developers to get into building real life projects with these technologies, get hands-on experience and get rewarded if the idea is sold or acquired on the platform.
 
Just like how hackathons are, you get into building using these technologies solo, and list it on this platform. When project is listed, you are rest assured that your project if reviewed and passes more than 2 votes would be rewarded. This is just an initiative made for Buidlers and to reward them. 

This platform tends to support building decentralized applications on the Klatyn blockchain and also using other techonologies like Covalent e.t.c. It makes use of the trust, and permissionlessness of the blockchain to reward builders


# How it works
a. The smart contract handles the following functionality: Register project, Vote Project, Reward Builder e.t.c

b. The front end enable users list projects and interact with the already deployed smart contract



# Others
The smart contract was deployed to BaoBab and here is the link  https://baobab.scope.klaytn.com/account/0xb44E8d6C64c51EA8CE76fE3766f3e3C19289256E?tabId=internalTx
